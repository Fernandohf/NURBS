# NURBS UI
A simple UI for understanding Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS).

## User Interface
The user interface is divided in two parts.

### NURBS Definition
The following properties of the curve can be altered:
 - Control Points
 - Weights
 - Degree
 - Number os segments interpolated(for visual smoothness)
 - Curve domain (2D o 3D)

### Examples
A sequence os examples showing the incredible versatility that can be achieved using NURBS.
